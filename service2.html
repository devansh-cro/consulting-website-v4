            <p class="big-service-heading">My Differentiation Philosophy</p>
                <p class="description-s1" id="diff-description">
                    Differentiation can help you scale faster & get greater market share in much less time compared to other companies. Only issue is there is a huge confusion on how to <span style="color:black;"><b>differentiate correctly</b></span>. Firstly, there's two kinds of differentiation (based on my experience).
                    <br><br>

                    <span style="color:black;"><b>The Company's Opinion Differentiation: </b></span>In this case, the company thinks it is unique. But this is their goddamn opinion and not the customer's opinion. I'll give an example: When I am talking to founders in saturated spaces like the skincare space, I usually ask them what makes their company different. They usually answer by saying "we are paraben-free, natural, cruetly-free and have great reviews!". <u><b><span style="color:black;">But in reality, literally all of their competitors say the same thing.</span></b></u> In this situation, almost all of these brands look the same to a customer (but the company thinks it is different somehow). Another issue is sometimes they are truly different but fail to communicate it properly (and they have no way of verifying if their copy works properly).<br>
                    <br>

                    <span style="color:black;"><b>The Customer's Opinion Differentiation: </b></span>This happens when customers choose a product because they think the company they are buying from is different from the rest of their options. This approach focuses on attributes and qualities that customers genuinely value and perceive as unique. Differentiation strategies under this category stem from thorough market research and understanding of customer's implicit and explicit decision making criterias. <br><br>

                    <span style="color:black;"><u><b>Also, some companies may be think "the top brands aren't focussing on stuff like differentiation, so why should us?".</b></u></span> The answer is pretty simple. It's because top brands are the default safe choice for most customers. They are already market leaders. They have already captured enough share for themselves. There can be ton of reasons why they got the top - early mover advantage, excess capital and so on.
                    <br><br>
                    <span style="color:black;"><u><b>New & small/medium players in the market are usually not the default safe choice.</b></u></span> Also, since there are a ton of new and small/medium competitors entering the market (who also use the same messaging). It becomes harder to stand out from the noise. This is where differentiation becomes crucial.

                        <p class="general-paragraph" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top:5px;">I'll create a list of top competitors & leaders in your market. Then I'll do a competitor analysis based on certain attributes.</p>

                    <p class="service-steps">02: Perception Tests</p>
                        <p class="general-paragraph" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top:5px;">This is where we get customer centric. I will be conducting studies with focus groups (usually your customers and non-customers in the same market) to understand how do they perceive different companies presented to them. This will help us in understanding if they think there is a noticeable difference in the companies or they all just look the same to the customer. This will also help us understand on what explicit and implicit decision making criterias customers use when deciding which brand to pick when they have tons of options available. </p>

                        <p class="general-paragraph" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top:5px;">There will be a high chance your company will be viewed as just another company or maybe you'll get some insight on how customers think of your brand in ways you never thought of. After the perception test, we will be using my "proprietory differentiation framework" to conceptualize different angles we can use to position your company differently. This phase will require attention & constant feedback from all key decision makers in your company since we're working on something that will change the direction of your company.</p>

                    <div class="steps-box">
                        <p class="service-steps">04: Final Perception Tests</p>
                        <p class="general-paragraph" style="line-height: 1.8; margin-top:5px;">Aftering conceptualizing various differtiation angles, we can't just roll them out right away. We want to mitigate any potential risk. So, we will be conducting another phase of Perception Tests. We will observe if our focus groups are able to see any signficant difference between your company (with its new differentiation angle) and other companies. Once we're able to verify that customers are truly perceiving your brand differently comapared to other competitors, then we will roll out A/B tests to how see does the differentiaion angle work in the real world.</p>
